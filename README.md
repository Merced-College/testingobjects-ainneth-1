Checkpoint Q1: Printing an object with no toString shows a hashed memory address, from the object library( a default constructor)[Dog@1dbd16a6]. The reason for why is that every class within java inherits from an object class(ex toString method, where the class name is utilized, an @ symbol, and a integer or the hash code of the memory address. 

Checlpoint Q2: The three fields printed, when default were; name= null
age = 0
breed = null
Things in Java thar are with capital letters ( like String) are reference types, therefore name and breed are reference types. The things that AREN'T capital are set to 0 ( int or double), and therefore age is a primitive type.
